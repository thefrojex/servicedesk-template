-- Live board: the app subscribes (Supabase Realtime, postgres_changes) to inserts on its own
-- activity_log - every change from the app, another tab or the WhatsApp assistant writes one - and
-- reloads and animates what changed. Realtime applies the table's RLS, so only active members hear
-- about changes. The publication is the project's standard one; adding this app's table to it
-- touches nothing else.
